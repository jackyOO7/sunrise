Example Python script for scraping location-based sunrise and sunset times from the web (USNO web site), data wrangling using Pandas and plotting using Matplotlib. 

For anyone looking for my final solution to this problem, see "Sunrise Notebook final2.ipynb".
An earlier version without web scraping can be found in "Sunrise Notebook final.ipynb"
Early working can be seen in "old.py" and "Sunrise Notebook working.ipynb". 

The .txt files are local data files that were downloaded previously by scraping the relevant webpages.
